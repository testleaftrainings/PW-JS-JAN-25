## Device Emulation

### Overview
- Playwright allows testing on different devices by emulating their characteristics (e.g., screen size, user agent).

### Use Cases
- **Responsive Testing**: Test how the application behaves on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Verify that the application works across different browsers and devices.

### Example
  ```javascript
  const { devices } = require('playwright');
  const iPhone = devices['iPhone 12'];
  
  const browser = await chromium.launch();
  const context = await browser.newContext({
      ...iPhone,
      locale: 'en-US',
      geolocation: { longitude: 12.4924, latitude: 41.8902 },
      permissions: ['geolocation']
  });
  const page = await context.newPage();
  ```

## Geolocation

### Overview
- Playwright supports geolocation, allowing tests to simulate different geographic locations.

### Use Cases
- **Location-Based Testing**: Test applications that provide location-specific content or services.
- **Geofencing**: Verify the behavior of applications that restrict access based on user location.

### Example
  ```javascript
  await context.setGeolocation({ longitude: 12.4924, latitude: 41.8902 });
  await page.goto('https://example.com');
  ```

## Visual Testing

### Description
Visual testing in Playwright involves comparing screenshots of web pages or elements to ensure they appear as expected. This helps catch visual regressions in the UI.

### Use Case
Automated visual testing ensures that UI changes do not unintentionally affect the appearance of web pages. Itâ€™s especially useful for validating design consistency and catching unexpected layout shifts or styling issues.


## Custom Fixture

### Description
Custom fixtures in Playwright allow you to set up and tear down resources that are needed for your tests.

### Implementation
Define custom fixtures:

```javascript
export const test = baseTest.extend({
    page: async ({page},use) =>{

       //Set up the fixture

        await use(page);
}
})
```
## Persistent Context

To launch a persistent context, which is useful for scenarios where you need to maintain the same browser state across multiple sessions, you can use the `launchPersistentContext` method.

### Example

```javascript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';

(async () => {
  const userDataDir = './user-data-dir';
  const browserContext = await chromium.launchPersistentContext(userDataDir, {
    headless: false,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
  });

  const page = await browserContext.newPage();
  await page.goto('http://www.leaftaps.com/opentaps');
  // Perform actions on the page

  // Close the context and browser when done
  await browserContext.close();
})();

```
